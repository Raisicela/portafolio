        I am a developer with more than three years of experience in generating code for personal and business projects. I focus on implementing web interfaces that are attractive, functional and accessible, using the best practices and tools of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am passionate about web design and continuous learning of new technologies and trends.

        In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husky, who is very playful and loyal. I also like to assemble jigsaw puzzles, which challenge my logic and creativity.
